            Review this pull request for:
            - Code quality and adherence to project conventions (vanilla JS, 2-space indent, kebab-case CSS, const/let with semicolons)
            - Correctness and potential bugs
            - Performance issues
            - Test coverage gaps (project requires 80% coverage threshold)
            - Ensure no pre-defined UI templates or component types are introduced (the project uses agentic UI generation)

            Be concise and actionable. Focus on issues that matter, not style nitpicks already covered by conventions.
